A programme that can generate colors with a given RGB value

You can input the color as follows: 255 255 255
In which case this becomes white.

If you want to input a color like red you have to do it like this: 255 000 000

This will generate a bitmap image with that color.

The color will not only be created as a bitmap image ,but it will also be displayed.
