CIDLE is a IDE for C and C++ progammes

Saving Files
------------

When you click on the menu you will see something called SAVE AS.
Click on that and you will be able to save your code in 
your computer.

Keep in mind that only saved code can be run.

Temporaly Saving Files
-----------------------

Every time you open the app your code would have already 
been saved as long as you pressed Ctrl + S.

The code gets saved in a specific file called temp.txt

Running Files
-------------

When you want to run the file clikc on the RUN button in the
menu, this would create an exe file in the saved location.

If you saved your project as new.cpp the exe files name would be
new.exe.

For a file to run it should be saved first.

Customizer
----------

The customizer can be opened in the menu in the code section. This
allows you to change the font, font color, and background color.

To increase the size of the font click Ctrl and roll your mouse wheel.

New
---

When you click on the new button everything would be reseted. This means 
that the content in temp.txt would be reseted and the text in the code box
would go away.

It also means you would not be able to run the previouse programme that you 
just coded and you would have to open it if you want to run it.
